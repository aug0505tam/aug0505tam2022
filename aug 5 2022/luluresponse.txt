Dear bitch, 
You are very welcome I am your friend congrats on turning 17 I’m not good at writing letters like you are with ur fucking 3 paragraph essay you sent see I’m still sitting here thinking abt what to write. You are a great friend I’m congrats on getting closer to death I’d give you a gift but I say my friendship is one (yw) and you sending me that personal letter is a highlight of how we’ve gotten pretty close despite knowing each other for a few months. So thanks for being my friend let’s hope I receive another letter like this next year.
